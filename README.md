The COVID-19 pandemic has placed a significant strain on healthcare systems. Early and accurate diagnosis of COVID-19 patients is crucial for effective disease management. This research tackles the challenge of early and accurate COVID-19 diagnosis using chest X-rays. The authors propose lightweight CNN models, a type of artificial intelligence, to automate this process. While an initial model achieved high accuracy (99.5%), limitations in the data quality were identified. To address this, researchers employed data pre-processing techniques like balancing, expert review, and data augmentation. These improvements led to a highly accurate final model.
Researchers explored using lightweight CNNs to automatically detect COVID-19 from chest X-rays. Though an initial model achieved high accuracy (99.5%), limitations prompted further refinement. By optimizing the model, they achieved significant performance gains. Accurate and early COVID-19 diagnosis is vital, but chest X-ray data presents challenges for machine learning models. Lightweight CNNs offer a solution for automated detection. Data pre-processing techniques (balancing, expert review, augmentation) improved data quality.
Finding the optimal number of convolutional layers is crucial to avoid overfitting. The researchers addressed this, leading to model improvement.
